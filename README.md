# FinanceDash

##Description
-This is a finance dashboard web app to view enterprise financial data (eventually in real time) using the MERN stack 

##Citation
-based on a tutorial by [EdRoh](https://www.youtube.com/@EdRohDev) on Youtube  

##Learning experience
-went through project in order to learn how web apps are actually made using the industry standard frameworks contrary to the classic HTML/CSS/JS taught in class at Dalhousie
-I learnt how the project is divided into frontend and backend (client/server model) and how the development of frontend and backend goes hand in hand and not necessarily in order of frontend and backend 

##Current Status
-*Project is currently in progress*, but each time i encounter an issue not mentioned in the tutorial videos I am able to figure out new ways to solve and debug problems on my own
-Presently working on *mongoDB connection issues* with the app server due to *issues with mongoose deprecation*

##Future additions upon completion
-EdRoh misses a few features in his tutorial project that are often found in modern day web apps, such as the expansion of widgets on hover and the availability of more options to interact with the widgets as hover view for that widget is activated
